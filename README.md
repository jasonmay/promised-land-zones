promised-land-zones
===================

Parsed representation of all the zones from Promised Land

Why?
----

I like to write small MUDs to play around with new concepts that I am interested in learning. I like to have a preset fixture of game data to use to save time in content creation so I use this zone data. This is, in theory, an exhaustive set of the game data from the MUD Promised Land.

What is Promised Land?
----------------------

Promised Land (PL) is one of my favorite games growing up. It has been out of service for several years now, but I like to use its data and mechanics for nostalgic purposes.

It's not perfect!
-----------------

Yeah, my parser is probably not air-tight. And the legacy zone stuff isn't in the best format, so if you spot something, send a pull request or even just give me a heads-up. Thanks!
