promised-land-zones
===================

Parsed representation of all the zones from Promised Land

Why?
----

I like to write small MUDs to play around with new concepts that I am interested in learning. I like to have a preset fixture of game data to use to save time in content creation so I use this zone data. This is, in theory, an exhaustive set of the game data from the MUD Promised Land.

What is Promised Land?
----------------------

Promised Land (PL) is one of my favorite games growing up. It has been out of service for several years now, but I like to use its data and mechanics for nostalgic purposes.
