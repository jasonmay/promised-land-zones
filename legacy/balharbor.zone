Zone Name: balharbor
Author:  Crimefighter smlucas@flashmail.com
Notes: Basically, you can connect this zone anywhere you wish...but keep in mind there is the sea along the southern border of it.  This version of it has it connected to two existing zones as it is on Promised Land, that being Yllythad Sea to the south, and Camelot to the east.  Camelot's connection would have to be modified, after mapping the forest area it looked like a straightforward little figure that you will see in the bhmap object below...almost, three rooms look like they were misplaced conflicting with the picture.  If you need the Yllythad Sea to go with this as a connector I could send that one over for you to use on request.  You will need to add the quest flag Freedom.

I had to murder many people in this city, because they refused to get along
and all these adventurers passing through would start learning about them.
If I do not prevent these people from learning how strife and politics
I will be forced to listen to this crap and have to move away again!  I shall
be forced to leave, but I CANNOT TOLERATE THOSE DAMN PEOPLE ARGUING!!!  I 
would rather jump into a erupting volcano and be incenerated than live
among people who preach to me how I should live!  I DO NOT WANT to know
the consequences of my actions!  I MUST DO EVERYTHING MY WAY!'

The Sewer Entrance^
    This is the start of the Bal Harbor sewer system.  You detect a faint 
scent of methane down the tunnel as well as some large footprints made by
some upright walking reptile.

The Sewer Pipe^
    Going down the sewer pipe, it becomes dark very quickly.  You hear
trickling water further down and the smell of methane fumes begins to increase.
Footprints go right into a side tunnel going east.

The Sewer Pipe^
    The pipe continues on down, and the water looks even more icky.  The 
methane fumes have increased considerably, and if you don't get some fresh air 
fast, you could perish.

The Sewer Grate^
    The pipe stops here at a large grate with the icky-looking water 
flowing on through.  The thick methane fumes in this section make it 
impossible to breathe.  You can't hold your breath for much longer.

The Lair^
    You seem to have entered someone's lair.  Footprints and hacked 
walls can be seen everywhere.  Looking around, you can see that a fight 
occurred here recently and the fighters must have taken a break and left 
their weapons lying around.  Apparently their sansei won't be took happy 
when he finds out they left it and you took it.

Base of Tower^
    Going out the side door of the Mage's Guild, you are at the foot of a
tall spooky-looking tower which is shrouded in dark clouds and thunder and
lightening.  Looking straight up, you can't even see the top of the structure
and wonder what could be hiding up there.  You sort of wonder who would occupy 
this tower, but looking up toward the entrance you see some spirit guards 
wielding bastard swords.  You may have to go up there eventually, but 
considering how much you're trembling in fear, only as a last resort.  Stairs 
leads up to the tower while you can double back to the north.
^

Stairs of Tower^
    As you climb the stairs you can see the sky around you become dark
already.  You notice some transparent figures floating about that see you
coming and swarm together in preparation of attack.  The door leading into 
the tower is just past them upward while you can escape back down.

Entrance to Tower^
    Having successfully getting past the guards, you stand at the front
door of the tower.  If you can figure a way inside, you will have to figure
out how to get up to the top without getting lost.  You notice it's a lot
darker here than it was below--it looks like it's gonna get a whole lot 
darker inside.

Tower Foyer^
    Boy it's sure dark in here, hope you brought some light.  The foyer
area is lit up with some torches hanging about but you can't see much of 
anything down any of the corridors.  Eerie noises can be heard from some
unknown source.  You wonder who, or what is living inside this tower.  Wonder
where the host is to give you a guided tour?

you see an expensive scarlet rug, a king-sized bed with silk sheets and 
velvet blankets covering it, a large nightstand with a rare Ming vase, a 
sizable rack of various wines, and a huge cedar dresser.  Some strange
trinkets are sitting in one corner of the room, which seem to be different

    You step inside the Sash Headquarters into the reception area.  This
place is carefully guarded from the rioters in order to protect the sash
commander.  It looks to be highly furnished, with a beautiful rug with the
sash insignia sewn into it spread on the floor.  Some trophies of past sash
excursions line the walls along with a few skulls of those gotten rid of.
If you can get past the guards you can go south into the commander's office.

    This is pretty much where the orders are given out.  A man sitting
behind a desk planning strategy, marking his battleplans, looking for spots
where he can gain more effective control, exploit some unsuspecting rioters
into things to gain an advantage...yet the guy is no pushover, he is a
deadly fighter himself.  The sooner he is taken out however, the faster the
troops fall apart and go their separate ways leaderless.

    Welcome!  You're standing at the entrance to Bal Harbor, a troubled
city plagued by riots and is currently under martial law enforce by the Red
Sash.  There is a large sign next to the gate which informs everyone about
the current strict curfew hours of the city and another poster alongside
offering a reward for information leading to the arrest and capture of the 
individual responsible for assasinating the mayor of Bal Harbor.  Another

Stepping through the city gates, it seems that the city appears to have 
suffered from a riot recently.  And as you look around, you see large men
wearing red sashes across their uniforms and the residents moving around
cautiously.  Grim looks can be seen on many people's faces, and you wonder
by coming to this city if you are even welcome here.  City streets run each 
direction, Cross Road runs north through the wizards' shopping center,
while to the south is the way to the ocean port.  Main Street runs east 
toward Idol Square or you can head back out of town to the west.

make their stand against the rioters until the Sash were called in help

This building still stands due to the fact that it was built using marble

sits upon it.  There are two tables where the plaintiff and defendant sit, a 
jury box for twelve jurors, and several other seats for the audience.  Due to 
the riots, court is not in session right now, so there's no worry of being

Not much you can do here, this house probably is irreparable now.  You

    Boy, I wouldn't want to see the owners' reaction when they come home
to see this!  This house looks no different than all the others you've seen,

    Now this house appears to be in better shape than the others, but still 
looks to be rundown due to poor upkeep by the owners.  In fact, the owners 
don't really care about the shape of the house, since they are clueless and 
dumb.  A large couch dominates the living room, some junk litters the floor, 
some of the wallpaper appears torn from the walls, yet the place seems wired 
for cable!  You can exit back to Pines south.

It looks kind of run-down, and you hear music coming from it...along with
some laughing and snickering.  You see another house to the south, you see
some ugly-looking sick people coming in and out of it.  Ugh!  Some

there's a ladder here that will allow you to have a day at the beach, there's

Beach goers notice that you are a stranger here and approach you yelling 
and screaming that you are trespassing here demanding you get lost.  You 
better leave this beach back upward to the dock before they all kick sand

and try to swim away from them to the south.  The beach extends itself for

Mayor's House^
    Here's where it all started.  Turmoil over the mayor's ability to
lead Bal Harbor began when someone in town was a victim of a rather hideous
crime--robbery, assault, and rape--all while some officers watched
(actually, paid to watch since it was apparently staged).  So, the public
got into a big uproar over the thing and demanded the cops resign along with
the mayor.  The mayor refused to resign and became defiant.  With stealth
Red Sash support and provocation by undercover agents, they were successful
in starting a riot.  The mayor blockaded himself with a few officers to
defend him but those men were really undercover Red Sash operatives--who 
were ordered in advance to take him out at just the right time.  As you can
see they were successful.  The rest of this place was soon ransacked after
the operatives opened the doors and let everyone in.  The scene now is too
awful to describe, so I guess you will have to imagine what's in here.

	You have come up upon a large number of white pillars of salt.  What
was a supposedly large number of Bal Harbor's residents are now all frozen
in place.  Here these people had gotten over their fear and gathered at 
this locale outside the city.  Then the arguing started, and they split up
into sides blaming each other for what triggered the riots.  It got so
heated that they started brawling in the middle of the road, from the look
of the tracks in the dirt.  But suddenly it came to a stop.  There's a
strong precense of magic here, it seems someone wanted the fighting and
bickering to end...permanently.  You can work your way through the pillars
and enter the center of it to the east if you want to risk an encounter
with the magic's source, or walk around the pillars north and south.

/*   A large number of Bal Harbor's residents have gathered at this locale
outside the city, refugees from the riots.  Here these people have gotten 
over fear and now are arguing loudly among themselves looking for someone
to blame.  It seems that they have divided themselves up into two factions,
one group off to the left side of the road, and one group on the right side
of the road.  As a consequence of the high-tension debate, a sizable number
of the refugees standing on each side of the road are brawling in the middle,
delivering a horrible beating to those hapless enough to pass between them.
Many years from now, you might see this scene repeated over and over in 
government forum meetings!  You can avoid this mess by going back west.  */

The pillars are too close together to go between.  You will have to try going
around them on the other side.

/*    You choose to go around the gathering of refugees on the left side. Here
the people that have taken this side are begging you for money and to build
new homes for them.  Several of them are shouting to the people on the other
side that the riots would never have happened if the rich folks in town were
not stealing all the food and property of the poor.  Others in the crowd 
complain the riots wouldn't have happened if that trade route was never 
opened with some nation on the other side of the Yllythad Sea...cause all
the work supposedly left for less expensive labor.  Several of these people
look like strong, hard laborers.  Backtracking to the west is the only way 
out since the people here won't let you pass without any donations.  */

room to get around the pillars here and rejoin the road on either side.

/*    You choose to go around the gathering of refugees on the right side. Here
the people that have taken this side are shouting at the people on the other
side that the riots happened because the people became sick and tired of the
ruling body interfering in their lives.  Despite their good intentions, all
that's happened is increased pain and misery among the residents physically,
emotionally, and financially.  They yell at the other side to take control of
their own destinies for once and stop looking for people to do it for them.
Several of these people look like merchants and traders who gladly allow you
to pass them to the east. */

The Reading Room^

angry people deemed everything sold here blasphemy and throughly tore this 
place apart.  It seems some people got the bright idea that if they destroy 
every piece of literature that had a hint of politics in it, that all the 
strife and in-fighting between all the political factions will go away.  Bits,
ashes and scraps of paper litter this room, most of it rendered unreadable.

The trip on foot won't be easy, cause the growth disguises the trail a
