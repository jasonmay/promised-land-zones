Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

The giant oak is covered in thick blue-green mosses and dark swaying
ivy. Some images have been carved and charred in by a fiery 
touch, a sternly beautiful woman with a ruby dagger sheathed at
her waist stands beside a man with the robe of the priesthood.
The cold wind of the sea blows the sails of the rocking ship they
ride upon. The rogue woman is imploring a second man to destroy
a beast far too great for his strength, a cruel smile playing
upon her lips. 
The image is frozen upon the bark, immobile, yet it is apparent
she is winning the battle. Beneath the picture are engraved the
words 'Know thy limits'.

should look at the world map and find out where this zone is attached to.
We put this message here though just to tease you--but if we have the
lockout chip for undone quests in place, you're seeing this note either
after you did the quest or found a trick to get into the zone anyway.
For your information though, this is the center of the whole zone.

The sunken temple courtyard^
   The pale light from the open sky pours always into this unsheltered
courtyard, together with the amber glow of standing torches. Many
citizens of the town of Sundhaven find it their pleasure to lounge
here. The dark marble temple rises like a shadow to the north, the
vivid colors of roses eastwards, and the library lies to the west.
There is a stone arch to the south.

in a sloping spiral. A stairwell has its foot at the north wall,
rickety but presumably stable enough to support you. A dim violet

narrow black lab tables cluttered with a chaotic mess of bubbling vials,
shattered beakers, and miscellaneous spell components. The latest
experiment in familiars, a leathery-skinned fork-tailed creature,
hops knavishly from shoulder to shoulder among the mages at work here.
If you need practice in the magic arts, this would be a good place to start.

   In the shade of old gnarl-limbed elder trees stands the bane of all 
thieves and murderers, the platform of the gallows. The dark sand of the 
road shows none of the blood that has been shed here, but the legends of 
the dead live on in tales and nightmares. The executions still take place 
at irregular intervals, to the joy of hidden enemies and law-abiding

Besides the east-west road, a stone arch stands to the north, and a

   The den of sorcery for mages and witches and wizards is a comfortable

of tomes. There is a rug in guild colors of blue and violet which spans
the stone floor, and hammocks hang in rows along the walls, where the
mages take their repose. A series of bookshelves provide ample guild
literature, and an oak coffee table before a couch dominates the room.

Fresh bread and cool drink await those within who are willing to
pay for the service, and about the city, other willing merchants
may also be found in abundance.
   Eastwards the land stretches in unmarred wilderness to the far
horizon, and to the southeast you think you can catch glimpses of
the thatched roofs of yet another village, this one smaller and more
humble.
A trail south along the cobblestone wall seems to head in that direction.

   You follow the thick wall of grey cobblestone that marks the

hides portions of the wall under its green tendrils. A stony

southwards to a corner.

   A four foot grey stone cliff, matted with clumps of green moss
and overhung with tall bending trees, is easily scaled by handy

   An old temple stairwell winds down in darkness into the inner, long
abandoned recesses of the golden temple. It seems few have reason to 
travel this way. The dust that coats the steps lies mostly undisturbed,
