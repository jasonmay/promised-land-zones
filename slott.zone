    The page you have look up is about what happened a dark night
    for many years ago. The night when the castle was over taken
    by the evil creature that you now is searching for.
    The butler has written down the following:
    'It was a dark and stormy autumn night when we first heard 
    an awful scream, it was the &+Rmrs&* of the house that had 
    Encountered the creature in the library. When I got there 
    she was gone. Then later that night the &+Rson&* and the 
    &+Rdoughter&* disappeared, now one has ever seen them again. 
    But every night when there is a fullmoon, the screams of the
    missing family members are heard echoing through the castle. 
    I have hidden my &+Rmaster&* in the northeast tower hoping 
    that the creature will not find him there. I don't know why
    the creature haven't taken me, couse I know it could have,
    I woke up one night and saw it standing in the doorway to 
    my room but it backed away from me when I stood up and was to
    jump it. I thought I could capture it and lock it inside the
    closet. &+YBut it ran away, as if I would SMELL bad or something&*.
    OH god if I was 30 years younger, I would have gone down into
    the basement to kill this horrible monster, but ack I'm to old
    and weakened to wield a sword nore less to hit with it. I'm 
    glad that I had the strength to destroy the stairs down to 
    the basement, preventing IT from coming up here again. Now 
    there is only &+Cone&* way left down there, but that way only 
    leads down &+bso the one who dares to go down might be stuck 
    &+bthere for ever&*! The way down is a &+Csecret passage&* that my 
    &+Rmaster&* only knows of and he won't reveal it to me, maybe

Family Sanctuary^
    You have entered the sacred temple of the castle. Here the family of the 
house say their prayers. Now it hasn't been used for a long time and dust 
covers everything! But you can still see the &+Bkrusefix&* on the wall, and 
the paintings pretending the almighty God and his son Jesus. There are also 
some church &+Bbenches&* here.

    The kitchen is large, large enough for several cooks to work here at the 
same time. There is a big &+Bstove&* placed in the middle of the room, the 
walls are filled with &+Bcupboards&* and &+Bdrawers&*. You notice that this 
room has been used recently, there is no dust or filth anywhere.

    This is where the family of the house eats their dinner. The room is big

and your stomach starts to rumble.

    This hall seperates the servants' area from the rest of the house. There

for the moment.

Backhall^
    This is the servants' entrance to the castle, this room is Spartan 
furnished with small benches and hooks on the walls to hang up their outdoor 
clothes. The door in the eastern wall has been forced of it's hinges and 
lies outside on the stairs, looking out through the hole where the door's

    The walls are covered with old paintings of a beautiful garden. They 
are from different seasons; winter, summer, autumn but you can't find one

prettiest seasons?

Hallway^
    The hallway ends abruptly, the ceiling has caved in blocking the doors 
to the east. As you examine what's left of the ceiling you see some marks 
as if someone has used a big sledgehammer on it. And you start to think that 
the ceiling has been deliberately made to cave in, just as if someone wouldn't 
let someone in or OUT.

    You find yourself in a dark moist tower room. There is a &+Bdoor&* in the
