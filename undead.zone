than anything a warrior may choose to use.  It points out that this evil

benefits of protecting oneself with an automatic magic generator, and
points out while the effects may be draining additional magic can be used
simultaneously to devastating effect....It finishes off mentioning the 
virtues of powerful stones that decrease the drain on a mage's resources
while increasing there ability to concentrate and get their spells correct
on the first attempt....it mentions that these combined with a magical
hat.  It describes a mage armed with these items and adopting these

feeling you really don't want to be here.  As you consider sitting by the

    As you step into the room you are rushed into void of what seems to be
BILLIONS of stars shooting straight at you but realize they are not striking
you, just flying by.  You shake your head realizing you've stepped into a
magical portal and are floating above what seems to be nothing.  This looks
like a safe place to rest before your brave adventure continues, for you do not
know what might be on the other side of this strange magical portal.  The

    Well it looks as though your journey may be coming to an end. Within
these walls is the &+RUndead King&*.  Not as tough as he made out really.
Before you stands a large open portcullis, and to your &+Csouth&* is the
open drawbridge.  You look around nervously wondering why anyone would
have a portcullis and leave it open?  Oh well enough of contemplation...

    The hairs on the back of your neck stand on end as you enter this

    As you enter the banquet hall you can almost hear the ghostly remnants

Although the decoration is somewhat sparse, the hall is huge and must measure
some 500 foot square.  A large oak &+Btable&* runs in a square around the

Your own personal hell^

    &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind
&+Rworks frantically to explain what you see.  You sit in a dark and empty
&+Rroom. You seem to be waiting for someone you are not sure who.  All around
&+Ryou the sounds of revelry fill your ears.  But it is fine, you are
&+Rstronger than them. Some people are meant to be this way.....aren't they?

Your own personal hell^

    &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind
&+Rworks frantically to explain what you see.  You watch yourself a younger
&+Ryou, a wiser you out to conquer the world with all the you knew.  But then
&+Ryou remember they were there weren't they?  They were just so perfect,
&+Rthey kept getting everything that by right you knew should have been
&+Ryours.  You know they did not deserve what was yours, even if others
&+Rdon't.  That is all that matters.

Your own personal hell^

    &+RYou walk through the crimson void, disjointed and misplaced, your mind
&+Rworks frantically to explain what you see.  You seem to remember a face, a
&+Rvague and distant memory of someone, someone you knew.  Maybe they were a
&+Rfriend, you cannot quite remember.  The image blurs slightly as your
&+Rmemory slips.  You were friends you remember,  whatever did happen to
&+Rthem?

    &+RAll that you are is here, your very soul laid bare, your jealousy,
&+Rvanity, sloth, cowardice are all here and more...everything that holds you
&+Rback, all you fight against and pretend does not exist.  All your 
&+Rinsecurity and weakness are here for you to see,  all you have lost, all
&+Rthe dreams of what you may possess all clamour for attention, for they are
&+Rall the centre of your own personal hell.

     &+RAll is peaceful, a deep crimson caresses you and offers you gifts
     &+Rof untold wealth, power beyond your wildest imaginings, all that
     &+Ris, all that was and all shall be is yours for the taking.
     &+RYou need but reach out ...
