The land was plentiful with scrumptuous fruits,\ntoo plentiful, really. The fruits mutated when a meteor devastated a nearby \nvolcano and leaked posionous gases. Heavy concentrations of these gases \npromoted extreme growth in the fruits and led to the ascendence of their \ncivilization. The locals were horrified by the changes, but allowed \nco-existence. However, the Fruits would not tolerate being eaten. They \nregarded present-day apples and oranges as future kin, even though they had \nnot undergone any mutation. As expected, confined riots and minor skirmishes \ndissolved into an all-out war. Ultimately, the Fruits outnumbered the humans, \nand all of them were eradicated except for a few prisoners. The Fruit \nsorcerors unveiled their long-dormant magic and created human-Fruit hybrids. \nBut almost immediately following their creation, they were shunned by their \ncreators and became outcasts in the forest. Hurt and angry at the Fruits, the \nhybrids revolted. Again, the Fruits suceeded in decimating their enemy, but \none escaped. This hybrid, still retaining 50 percent of her humanity, had a \nplan for revenge. She developed a chemical formula which made all the Fruits \nsterile. The effect was immediate; the Fruits panicked when they learned \ntheir fate. Given the Fruits long life of a thousand years, she knew she \nwould have to wait. During this time period, she would periodically visit \nnearby towns and then quickly vanish. The surrounding neighborhoods picked up\nevidence of a being who they thought possessed immortality. After all, no \nmere mortal surely could live more than a century. Thus, they enshrined and \nconsecrated the Tor Forest to protect the secret of 'immortality.' Raised to \nthe status of a legend, the hybrid drew back to the safety of the forest and \ninwardly smiled as the last of the Fruits fell to the ground, becoming an \nextinct species. By this time, she was drawing close to the time of her \nown death. She was looking forward to it, and one day, stumbled onto this \nclearing. After planting the fruit trees to remind her of what the original \nforest looked like, she settled back and considered her life's work over.\n                        - As recorded by Fruitcake",
