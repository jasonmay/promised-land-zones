It once belonged to \nthe Arch Mage Of Legions, before he was slain by Talon. It was \noriginally used by the Arch Mage Of Legions for aid in his spellcasting.\nThe Talisman made his wounds heal faster, and emitted mana which added to\nhis already amazing spellcasting ability. It shall prove just as useful to \nme. The talisman recieved its power by the large moonstone in the centre.\nPerhaps I can harness the moonstone's power in a more efficient way.\n&+Y------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI broke new ground by inventing another type of wand. This wand can be \nused quite successfully to keep my foes at bay. Unfortunatly, it is\nvery difficult to charge. Once it is charged, however I will make Shazareth\npay for his insolence. It relys&+Rup&*on both the power of the Sun and the Moon.\nUnfortunatly, in order to be charged it must be exposed to the light of both\nat the same time. \n&+Y------------------------------------------------------------------------\nToday I will begin my experiments with the healing potion. This potion\nshould require less hard-to-find ingredients as Shazareth's potion \nrequires. In fact, a mere drop will heal all wounds! If this succeeds, \nmortals everywhere will flock to pay me with treasures untold for a few\ndrops of this precious liquid. Unfortunatly, one of the essential \ningredients contains a deadly poison. If this works I should be able to\nneutralize the poison and my potion will be a success!\n&+Y------------------------------------------------------------------------",
