The expedition\ncrossed this great mountain range, then descended into the rainforest and set\nout on their ambitious quest.  After some time they had a major disagreement\nand the group split up, one half continuing to battle through the forest while\nthe other built a raft and floated down the river.  The writer of the diary was\nin the party which took the slow route through the jungle.  During weeks of\nfruitless searching the party gradually dwindled, one by one falling victim to\none or other of the jungle's manifold hazards.  When there were only a handful\nleft, they abandoned their quest and attempted to return home.  The final\nentries in the diary are increasingly surreal, and it is plain that the writer\nwas steadily losing his grip on reality.",
