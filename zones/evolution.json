I found a quaint old jetty to the south of where we were digging, and\nslid into the water.  I immediately found myself in an extraordinary setting.\nAround me were hundreds of creatures the like of which I had never seen before,\nexcept in simulations of the Cambrian sea bed.  I realised I had stepped back\nin time over five hundred million years!  Naturally I did not waste the\nopportunity and set about collecting some evidence of my extraordinary journey.\n    As I continued to swim over the sea bed, I noticed the flora and fauna\nchanging, and new genera began to appear.  It became apparent that I was\nadvancing through time!  I had a little dig in the mud and unearthed a perfect\nearly fish skeleton, and I kept it, resolving to show it to the professor if\nand when I returned to the present day.  After a while I found myself in what\nmust have been the Devonian period, for I was beset by early sharks and\nplacoderms and God knows what else.  It was scary, and I had to swim like crazy\nin order to escape.  Somehow I found my way to land, and wandered for a while\nthrough a dark forest of carboniferous trees.  Knowing early reptiles often\nfell into rotting stumps I searched for hours for such a thing, but eventually\nI fell foul of a couple of large amphibians and had to make my escape.\n    Later, as I made my careful way through the Mesozoic (keeping a close eye\nout for dinosaurs, of which there were an alarming number!) I searched in every\nplace I could think of.  I left no stone unturned.  At length I ended up in a\ncave and there met the professor, and I realised that I had come full circle.\nIt was bizarre.  I gave him my eight skeletons and he was very excited, but\nkeen for more, so I returned to the jetty for a second bout.\n    And this is where I am now.  I'm about to re-enter the water to seek out\nmore intriguing discoveries.  I collected an ammonite shell from the Ordovician\nand I will store these notes inside until I am on dry land again.  My only fear\nis that I will meet one of those ferocious arthrodires again.  If I do, I think\nI might just abandon the quest and dump the aqualung.  If the professor is so\nkeen on more exhibits, let HIM be the one to face the danger!  Anyway, time to\ngo.",
