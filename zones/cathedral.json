From the looks of you I'd say a fine     |\n   | warrior as well, a rare combination. We apologize for the shabbiness     |\n   | of this little church, but a terrible tragedy has overcome us. Many      |\n   | years ago, a terrible vampire invaded our little village. Our protector, |\n   | Saint Suorac, tried to fight him, but to no avail. The Vampire easily    |\n   | defeated our valiant hero, and plunged the Cathedral into &+Ldarkness&*,   \n  |\n   | transforming it into his &+rdemonic lair&*, a malignant blot against the   \n  |\n   | &+Cskyline&*. It may be beyond salvation, for it houses many &+Levil&*\ncreatures,  |\n   | But hidden deep within are our precious holy relics. There are five of   |\n   | them. We urgently need for someone to brave the evils of the cathedral   |\n   | and return our relics to us. Four of the relics are material things of   |\n   | great spiritual value... The fifth is the very bones of Saint Suorac     |\n   | himself. It is our custom to save the bones of our holy defender, as a   |\n   | symbol of faith. If you are up to it, we would be most grateful if you   |\n   | would take up this quest, kill the vampire, and return our relics to     |\n   | this humble church. Perhaps when all this is over, we can return and     |\n   | rebuild our Cathedral into the holy place it once was. The &+RVampire&*    \n  |\n   | cannot be defeated easily. Find a way to use his powers against him.     |\n   | Take this key, it is old and &+yrusty&*, but it should open at least one of\n  |\n   | the doors.                                                               |\n   |__________________________________________________________________________|\n    \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n",
