When I got there \n    she was gone. Then later that night the &+Rson&* and the \n    &+Rdoughter&* disappeared, now one has ever seen them again. \n    But every night when there is a fullmoon, the screams of the\n    missing family members are heard echoing through the castle. \n    I have hidden my &+Rmaster&* in the northeast tower hoping \n    that the creature will not find him there. I don't know why\n    the creature haven't taken me, couse I know it could have,\n    I woke up one night and saw it standing in the doorway to \n    my room but it backed away from me when I stood up and was to\n    jump it. I thought I could capture it and lock it inside the\n    closet. &+YBut it ran away, as if I would SMELL bad or something&*.\n    OH god if I was 30 years younger, I would have gone down into\n    the basement to kill this horrible monster, but ack I'm to old\n    and weakened to wield a sword nore less to hit with it. I'm \n    glad that I had the strength to destroy the stairs down to \n    the basement, preventing IT from coming up here again. Now \n    there is only &+Cone&* way left down there, but that way only \n    leads down &+bso the one who dares to go down might be stuck \n    &+bthere for ever&*!
