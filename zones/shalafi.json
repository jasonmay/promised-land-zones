         "description" : "\n    As you enter the foyer of this house, the first thing that you notice is\nthe floor.  It is one giant slab of pink and white marble that stretches out\nto meet the walls which are made of black and white marble.  Carved within the\nwalls are steps that lead up to the rotunda.  At the far end of the hall are a\nbeautiful set of glass French doors.  Looking through these doors, you see a\ngrand sight indeed.  An expansive garden filled with an endless variety of\nflowers and plants stretches off to meet the massive hedge maze.  Beyond this,\nyou see the sparkling water of the ocean stretching off to the horizon where\nyou see the sun sinking beneath the waves.  Back within the room, you notice\na chandelier suspended in midair high above you.  To your amazement, it is not\nmade of glass, or even crystal, but sparkling diamonds!  Above this is the\nrotunda which contains the upper levels of the house.  Balconies covered with\nivy line the higher floors allowing one to look down.  At the very top is a\nstained glass skylight that allows a soft many hued light to filter down into\nthe room.  As for what is actually within this room, there is not much to see.\nThe most prominent feature is the pure black grand piano sitting majestically\noff in the far corner.  There are but a few other items within the room,\nincluding a few Escher paintings and the like.\n",
