There\nare milk-maids and shepherdesses, with bright-colored bodices and\ngolden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most\ngorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed\nin knee-breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them,\nand golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jewelled crowns\nupon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny\nclowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and\ntall, pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people are all made\nof china, even to their clothes, and are so small that the tallest of\nthem is no higher than your knee. A ladder leads south to the China\nLand, and north to a strange path.\n",
