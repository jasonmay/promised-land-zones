The waters of the sea are very still here, so still that they bring a

is associated with dread in a sailor's heart but a slowly moving roll
that promises a good day at sea.

The calm sooth mind and body, lending a feeling of peace and comfort

The wind has picked up a bit and has caused the sea to begin to churn
a bit, the water bobbing and jumping rapidly.  Every now and again a

the surface.  Bal Harbor's entryway lies just north from here, in

A thick fog has rolled in over the ocean's surface, obscuring what
