Gravel Pathway^
   The northern boundary of this section of the pasture is marked by
a rusty, creaking cattle gate, drifting open and closed slightly in the wind.
Narrow trails wind their way around a few randomly placed grave sites and
pool together by this gate. Leading northward is a wider, well-groomed
gravel trail, its sides accurately spaced by rocks lining the length of
the trail.

Gravel Pathway^
   The finely made trail continues north and south across untapped
wilderness. Some wayward pines pock mark the landscape to either side as
far as the eye can see. Families of animals live within the almost
hollowed-out trunks of these trees, where the slight wind chill factor of
these parts can never reach. Nestled among the pines stands a long
abandoned hovel, its thatched roof and stone walls strongly defiant
against the elements. The pine forest thickens to the north and stops a
smile to the south before the pasture.

Before the Thatched Dwelling^
   The gravel trail leads straight to the hut's main entrance and back west
to the T-intersection. Some small gardening &+Ctools&* and pieces of broken
flower &+Gpots&* are scattered here. One crossbar window by the front entrance
is shattered in one of its four panes, letting the wind whistle through it.
Soft pine needles, brown and lifeless, sweep around the area and through
the open doorway.

Main Room^
   A bed of dry, dead pine &+yneedles&* provides a natural layer of undergrowth
within an otherwise man-made structure. A wooden &+ycask&* with its rusting
bands decays at its own pace and will never likely hold any ales again.
Stuffed away in a back corner is a small fireplace, fashioned with a
hanging apparatus which supports a dented, cast-iron &+ypot&*. The bed is not
so fortunate, however. Its frame has splintered to dust and collapsed into
a small pile of termite-eaten debris, and the straw &+ymattress&* is musty and
decomposing. The only other pieces of furniture in the room are a simple
wooden rocking chair and a &+ychest&* of drawers, both of which lean at angles
enough to make the human eye ache.

Back Room^
   The air is fresh in here despite its locale to the outside world. Racks
of candles line all the stony walls at regular spacing, but their wicks
are now composed of ash and the candle wax of very poor quality. in the
center of the room is a deep square dug into the ground, its walls
reinforced with pine two-by-fours and tar pitch. A smooth block of marble
has been weathered and placed in the exact center of the pit. Attached to
each wall is an animal &+cskull&*, the bones glinting in your light.
^
fjord6 u:fjord5;
lflags { Dark }
Altar of Twilight^
   The pit dimensions have been measured to perfection, perhaps to ensure
that the rituals carried out here go smoothly. The wooden walls and
marble slab in the center were long since placed under magical protection
from the effects of erosion. The slab is decorated with many types of
quartz and treated with a super-hard coating of a potent magic solution in
an effort to keep legible the inlaid signatures of those who had
previously performed evocations to other planes of existence here.
Covering the sides of the slab to the ground are strings of carefully
pruned ivy as fresh and green as if they were sproutlings. The only exit
is out of the pit.

Small Pine Grove^
   A heavy cluster of wayward pines are grouped together irregularly away
from the major bulk of the forest. The trail leads in a complete circle
around the grove via a fork in the path. Every pine in this grove,
however, has been struck by lightning, their tops burnt to cinders. From
each lifeless trunk protrudes new shoots for future growth. Mingled within
the remaining branches are a few &+ynests&*, and chirps from baby birds getting
fed their earthly delight of squiggling earthworms bring new sparks of
life to this shattered grove.

Muskrat Pine Forest^
   All around are densely packed pine trees. Millions of cones hand from
the trees and litter the decaying undergrowth. A musty scent is present in
the dimly lit atmosphere along with the sweetness of sticky pine sap.
Occasionally, a deer will hop along at the edge of peripheral vision, its
only goals in life to feed its young and avoid being turned into roasted
venison. A gravel trail leads south to thinning forest and loses clarity
to the east.

Deer Trail^
   No signs have been erected to say 'deer crossing' happens here, but
there is sufficient evidence to let travelers know what kind
of population occupies this territory. Deer &+ydroppings&* resembling small
blueberries cannot avoid being stepped in except by their droppers, as
suggested by sets of hoof prints cleverly negotiating the maze of
excrement. Over time, the droppings feed nutrients into the soil, which
are then taken up by the brown and orange &+ylichen&* growing up the sides of
trees and boulders. One some rocks where there are large depressions from
erosion, the lichen fill the space in completely to form a spongy throne,
perfect for resting in.

Animal Trail Intersection^
   Two paths made by the forest dwellers have been left here. A deer trail
runs north and south, wide and easy to follow. A much more primitive track
heads east through the forest and comes to a quick halt at the base of a
pine &+gtree&* to the west.
^
fjord11 w:fjord10 e:fjord12;
lflags { Outdoors }
Muskrat Pine Forest^
   Sap concentrations increase further to the east, its production fueled
by the significant amounts of light and water in that direction. Clinging
to most trees in at least three places are the only life form unique to
this forest. The Sap Swarmers are a distant cousin of the small blood-sucking 
leeches, but gorge themselves on sap instead of the liquid of life. They
are equipped with serrated claws which cut through the protective lichen
and bark of the pine and allow access to the phloem, where the pine sap is
readily available, but are careful to avoid causing permanent damage to
the tree. Sap Swarmers lack eyes and ears, but have a wonderful detection
system of shape and dimension, which is why they will sometimes try to
attach themselves to a passing organism. The forest thickens to the west
and thins to the east.
^
fjord12 w:fjord11 e:fjord13;
lflags { Outdoors }
Muskrat Meadow^
   The pine forest never intrudes upon this wide expanse of grass, where
small children can easily get lost in. Flax, oats, and rye grow in
abundance in different sections of the meadow. Deer hop along nearby,
eating some of the grains, then drink their fill at a small lake to the
east. The ground here is well-tilled by the moles as they dig their
tunnels.
^
fjord13 s:fjord14 w:fjord12 n:fjord16;
lflags { Outdoors }
Sandy Lakeside^
   The meadow terminates at the beachline of the lake. The sand here is a
glistening pinkish-orange, sparkling in the sunlight or moonlight.
Roughly fifteen feet to the east, the crystal clear liquid of the lake
ebbs and flows gently, where some freshwater sand dollars eke out their
lives in ceaseless contemplation of their intertidal universe. Scitter
bugs live up to their namesake as they glide along the surface. and small
fish swim down the drop-off near the water's edge. A family of deer stand
on the shore further to the north, sipping quietly from the lake.
^

lflags { Outdoors }
Sand Pit^
   A puddle of water covers the bottom two inches of this sandy depression.
During the early spawning seasons, some fish deposit their eggs here,
given its natural protection from predators and proximity to the shore.
Over time, the hole has filled in with the surrounding sand as water
erodes away the sides. Therefore, kids who swim in the lake will dig out
the hole and place their feet in the warm water - sort of like a miniature
spa. The beach continues to wind around the lake to the north and south.
^
fjord15 n:fjord14;
lflags { Outdoors }
Debris-Ridden Beach^
   This is where the flotsam of the lake generally end up, as does most
litter from picnickers. Some fragments of faded red cloth from an old
towel and oxidized links from a now defunct suit of chain mail lay
partially buried by the sand. Many discarded sand dollar shells, broken
and splintered, dot the area as well. A long, thick pine tree blocks any
further progress to the southerly directions. It was deliberately placed
here to form a &+ydam&* centuries ago and has petrified since; the rocky
minerals sparkle like quartz. The sand here is dirtier because of the
strewn mess.
^
fjord16 s:fjord13 e:fjord17;

Pier Point^
   The beach narrows slightly here, drawing the meadow closer to its water
source. Rickety wooden planks and vine-tied support logs form a pier which
juts out eastward onto the lake.
^
fjord17 w:fjord16 e:fjord18;
lflags { Outdoors NoMobiles }
Rickety Pier^
   The boards creak underneath your weight. The pier was excellently made
to have been able to stand for as long as it has. Beneath the waters of
the lake, the ground quickly vanishes from view. This area for the pier
was selected because of the deep hole here, where the bigger trout and
catfish choose to reside. The pier ends near the edge of this hole as to
allow fisherpersons the most possible area of the hole to fish in.
^
fjord18 w:fjord17 e:fjord19;
lflags { Outdoors OnWater }
Lake Punjowltah^
   The smoothness of the lake is not broken easily. Most boats produce very
little wake in the crystal blueness, A school of small cutter fish ride
the gentle waves to and from their feeding areas and homes. Occasionally,
a larger fish will break cover and speed by, providing a glimpse of fins
and tail. A light wind blows across the lake, cool and refreshing, but
barely manages to ruffle the lake surface. Set out from the pier is a
bobbing &+Ybuoy&* in the shape of a duck, an animal now extinct in this area.
It was once used to help capture exquisite ducks, but now just floats
endlessly about the lake.
^
fjord19 w:fjord18 n:fjord20 s:fjord23;
lflags { Outdoors OnWater }
Middle of the Lake^
   The central area of the lake is a giant whirlpool. Water and surface
matter are drawn counterclockwise to am calm ring ten feet beneath the
lake surface, forming a large sunken pit of water. Once something is drawn
into the pit, it spirals down and then spits back up to the rim through
means of enormous air bubbles. This whirlpool is, therefore, not
considered dangerous, but used as a fun ride and a small challenge to
escape. 
^
fjord20 s:fjord19 n:fjord21;
lflags { Outdoors OnWater }
Northern Side^
   The slope of the bottom of the lake is much less sharp in this region.
Average depth of the water is perhaps ten to fifteen feet, and the bottom
is entirely sandy. Leading from the lake bank by the shore are two thick
fishing nets, tied securely to the shore and at every point along the lake
bottom. They are set far enough apart to admit a single craft, similar to
a private docking slot at a harbor. The waves of the leave gently push
towards the shoreline.
^

lflags { Outdoors NoMobiles }
Groomed Beach^
   The beach here has been shaped into a half-moon, letting the meadow edges 
grow right to the water. Lining this semi-circle are small rocks engraved
with pictures of hands. The rocks are a true work of art - each pair of
hands appears to be 'held' by the opposing hand of its neighbor, completing a 
link around the beach. Leading due north beyond the rocks is a pathway made 
out of mother-of-pearl quartz pebbles, which runs to a halt between two
towering pyramids of smooth stone. The lake stretches away to the south.
^
fjord22 s:fjord21;
lflags { Outdoors Peaceful }
Shrine of Tranquility^
   A ring of four smooth stone pyramids line a small area of cropped
bluegrass. The inner side of each stone is entirely reflective, where any
rays of the electromagnetic spectrum bounce off the highly polished
surfaces. The light is directed toward the center of the ring, enhancing
the eternal blue flame which burns at the heart of this shrine, streaked 
with enamel. The cast iron brazier upon which the fire rests glows red in
the heat. No offerings or sacrifices are made in this holy place as only
a magical ritual involving the human spirit can be done here.

lflags { Outdoors OnWater }
Southern Side^
   Eddies swirl around your craft in this calm area of the lake. There is
only a light wind to disturb the surface, although to the south the waters
build up into small waves. There is a rather large hole in the water to
the north. Around the reflection of the sun on the lake swim a school of
trout, while a catfish makes a giant leap across the width of it.

Southern Beach^
   The lakeside continues to be sandy around the south bank. Here the sand
takes on a darker glow with flecks of black in it. Clumps of soggy,
decaying &+yweeds&* and broken pieces of &+ybark&* wash up occasionally and deposit
themselves ever deeper into the sand. The dirt white line left by the
lake's foamy wave tips is prominent as it meanders across the beach. The
ebb and flow of the tide moves this line up and down at various times of
the day. A large tree trunk blocks the beach to the west, but the eastern
way is clear.
^
fjord25 w:fjord24 e:fjord27 s:fjord26;
lflags { Outdoors }
Mucky Ditch^
   The beach slopes downward into a wide ditch, where the bottom is filled
with lake water. A stretch of sand leads south to where the ditch ends at
a wall of muddy earth. This used to be stream which fed out of the lake to
the lower valleys. Now the high tides of the lake generated by the central
whirlpool drive some water into the sandy bed, keeping it moist. During
the late spring and summer, the ditch is a natural spawning ground for many
kinds of fish.
^
fjord26 n:fjord25;
lflags { Outdoors }
Deep Depression^
   The murky, sandy ditch continues right to a wall of root-entangled
earth. The grasses of the meadow surrounding the lake fight for room at
this once-upon-a-time lake outlet, all wanting the most water they can
scrounge up. This section of the ditch dips about a foot lower than the
rest of it to the north, and the larger amount of water makes for a nice
foot spa. Worms poke their heads or tails out of the sodden bank, where
they have eaten a path and are quickly reminded by the open air not to go
any farther.

Southeastern Bank^
   More sand greets your eyes as the beach hits a sharp corner. To the 
northeast is a gigantic, burned-out pine, its tangled roots poking toward 
the water in a futile effort to convince a passerby that it is still alive 
and kicking. A large cluster of broken &+ysandollars&* dot the water's edge, 
slowly being eroded by the waves. The beach narrows to the north as the 
meadow heads close to the lake, while it widens to the west.

lflags { Outdoors }
Eastern Shore^
   The meadow touches the lake here as the beach tapers out of existence. 
As a consequence, the water gets deeper much faster from the steeper 
incline of the meadow hill's underwater slope. To the due east, oddly 
enough, is a massive wayward pine tree, hollowed out by fire.
^
fjord29 w:fjord28;
lflags { Outdoors }
Wayward Pine^
   Some dead grass, windblown sand particles, and pieces or rotting bark 
litter the ground within this once great trunk. Off to one side neatly 
stacked in a tier are some fresh-looking &+ypinecones&*. The cones provide 
most of the color to this otherwise dead shell of a conifer. However, 
scratchings on the inside walls reveal more than simple animal claw 
marks; they are made in a fashion precise enough to be letters. The bark 
is cut by intricate patterns formed by these letters and their accompanying 
images of a circle surrounded by several outgoing rays. This area has not 
been so damaged by the fire which raged throughout the rest of the tree. A 
light breeze blows in from the west, bringing the smell of the meadow and 
more sand from the beach.

Deer Track Extension^
   Within the confines of the Muskrat Pines, the hallowed sounds of near 
total silence draw in traveler's empathy with the world of nature. The 
deer track continues to meander north and south, and the silence cannot 
be disrupted even by wandering from the trail. The animals abide by their 
granted environment and violate it only as necessary to survive, which 
explains the signs of feasting and excrement. A large collection of Sap 
Swarmers gather, and one pounces on a young, freckled fawn as the 
startled deer's curiosity draws it too close. Fortunately, the father is 
nearby and uses its antlers to pry the swarmer off before too much damage 
is done. With a dismissal wave of antlers, the buck leads his son back to 
where the family had been dining previously.

Bumps On A Log^
  A slew of fallen trees criss-cross the deer track here. Bugs inhabit 
crevices in the rot-eaten &+ylogs&* of what used to be tree trunks. The stench 
of decay is thick and rich, but the humidity of the atmosphere does begin 
to falter finally. It drops to the north and is greater in the less 
odorific areas to the south. The ground also begins to get hilly to the 
north as moss-covered stumps clamor upward from earthen mounds. The Sap 
Swarmers diminish to the north, perhaps unnerved by the slight climatic 
changes. Their home live relatively far to the south anyway. However, one 
striking change is that there are practically no deer living in this 
section of the Muskrat. The foliage remains relatively unscathed, and no 
blueberry-like droppings are present.

An End of the Track^
   The deer track comes to an abrupt halt as the undergrowth merges 
together from all sides. The northern sections of this pine forest are 
filled with less common animals, some of which are rumored to be titanic 
beasts. Many think it an old wives' tale to allure young children into 
eating their vegetables, but there have also been unconfirmed reports of 
people disappearing in this area, once even an entire expedition. An 
unobstructed way through the forest is to the east, and the deer have 
been kind and methodical enough to form a path leading south, more 
towards the heart of the of the Muskrats. The woods here are darker, and 
the trees more towering. Usually, it is rare to find pine trees that are 
over seventy-five feet tall, but perhaps the bones of the supposedly 
inhabiting beasts provide certain minerals into the ground and act as a 
super-growth formula.

Mowed Down^
   Something awful has been here! Trees have been ripped from their roots
and shoved aside as if they were no more than toothpicks. The forest floor
is trampled down by enormous &+yfeet&*; the spacing between the toes measures
no less than a yard across. Webbing spans that spacing, given the near
total leveling of the undergrowth. Light shines much more strongly
from the north, towards the border of the Muskrat Pine Forest, as a result
of the destructive travel. The rejoicing chirping of crickets echoes in
this section as the little green and black pests come to inhabit the
fallen trunks. Fresh sap runs over those trees, implying that this chaos
happened recently. To the west and east, the forest drops in altitude
slightly, but rises considerably to the north.

In the Thicker Undergrowth^
   Branches, leaves, and masses of roots protrude and block your way in all
directions. Progress is made with effort, but at least it is a good
workout. The sunlight fades as the forest floor drops down and the pines
rise overhead further to the south and east. Black pits lie there, and a
low, continuous buzz emanates from the eastern one. The ground becomes
soggy to the south, and something sloshing around is heard from that pit.
There is total absence of civilized animal life here, but it can be found
to the west.

Pit of Bugs^
   Oh dear, you've just wandered into a lair of creepy, crawling horrors!
Born of millions of shapes, sizes, and colors, the little six-legged and
winged critters crawl up your legs and buzz about your ears. The bottom of
the pit is made of total decayed mush and dead insects. If any water were
to ever get down here, then there would be a thriving colony of bacteria
inside the quicksand-like mass of bugs. The hole back to the land of the
living is a couple feet overhead, and very little sunlight makes it
through the clutter of undergrowth and around the sharp angle of the pit
sides. The violent movement of all the bugs causes the 'floor' to move
like waves on the ocean. Something very slimy and long slithers at the
nape of your neck.

Pit of Fungus^
   Your first step brings you sinking waist-deep into white, gooey muck.
The air is alive with the ripeness of death, as the muck lining the bottom
half of the pit is a large soup of fungal decay. Growing above the soup
are mushrooms which actually are alive and patiently wait the day when
they, too can become 'one with the soup.' Gnarled roots from nearby pines
and undergrowth reach down into the muck and draw life-giving nutrients,
leaving you with all the smelly stuff! Sunlight drifts in from the north,
but doesn't cause even the slightest reactions of photosynthesis here.

Slope of Dead Pines^
   There is a surprising number of dead pines along this route. The path of
the one who ripped asunder weeds to the south has visited this section
also, as claw marks are borne by the shredded bark on the long-deceased
trunks. To your right, a tree has even been felled by one monstrous sweep
and thrown a good twenty feet. The ground slopes upward to the north and
down to the regular forest level to the south.

Rise of the Mutated Cones^
   The Muskrats climb ever higher into these northern mountains. The trees
here are shorter and look much more surreal, aside from their cones. Hanging 
from the multitudes of branches spread aside the forcefully shredded track
you are following are pine cones the size of bee hives. The leaves are
perfectly round and spaced on each one, forming an artistic perfection
unheard of in nature. Yet this is not directly Mother Nature's doing, and
the most noticeable thing about the defects is the wide array of colors of
the cones - only a few are the standard brown. Differences are not limited
to the pine cones, as shown by the trunks, where varying tendrils of
thickness wind themselves like rope. Unlike a single, solid, wooden base
like most of these trees within the Muskrats, this form of life is much
more resilient in combating animals and the elements.

Steep Slant^
   There exists heavy indicators of an inverse relationship between the
altitiude and the number of trees. Parts of the mountain side are bare,
covered in nothing but chipped slate and pieces of loose earth. Each step
over these areas causes minor avalanches of gravel, and the effort of
treading such ground causes continual disruption of the ability to keep
alert. The fastest way to traverse this slope is via a shallow gully
filled with half-buried roots and gnarled, dried-up pine tree roots. About
a hundred feet below is where many miles of trees have been cleared by
huge hands, while the gully breaks in two up above, leading west and
north.
^
fjord40 e:fjord39 d:fjord41;
lflags { Outdoors }
Level Gully^
   Here a gully leads due east and west along a rocky slant, providing easy
cross-country access. It comes to an end at an open stretch of gravel -
the result of a landslide long ago. The slide did not manage to get a tree
right beside it, though, and the tree lived to a ripe old age as
originally intended. Now the deceased husk remains with the insides eaten
out, but its formidable root growth has prevented earth from filling in
the hollow center within itself. The bulb appears big enough for a small
elk to enter and take temporary refuge.

In the Bulb^
   Perhaps a great hiding place in trying to lose a party of high-strung
chasers, this nook within a dead pine's roots provides plenty of knobs
and knolls in which to reshape your back and give your butt permanent
depressions. It encloses like a rib cage, although wood instead of bone,
acting like a security blanket to its occupants. This tree died honorably
and continues to serve while in death. On one of the sides of the rooty
cage is a small, fairly deep &+yindentation&* filled with some rain water,
providing you with a deep reflection.

At the Treeline^
   The line of Muskrat pine marking the edge of the forest follows a
straight horizontal strip of small boulders here at seventy-five hundred
feet up from sea level. The partly cloudy sky seems much closer without
the cover of the forest of the mountain range's own minor cloud cover,
allowing a lot of ultraviolet light to be caught at this altitude. A
constant, sometimes gusty, wind blows across the yellowing grasses of the
mountainside, taking loose soil and making many small dust devils. Past
the boulders to the north is a small path which zigs-zags up the mountain,
while the Muskrats lead down and to the south. This is also an area of few
remaining forms of vegetation.

   Forged and broken in years ago, this path has been kept in excellent

clouds drift slowly.

   The trail stays snug against the mountain, where intermittent patches of
snow drop onto the level ground and melt. The ground grows much more muddy
to the east, where the trail ends at a glacier. Here the switchbacks occur
in greater number as the near vertical faces of the mountain swing into
view, still partially obscured by the clouds. The howl of a gusty wind
greets you everywhere at this level.

Entrance to Snow-Capped Peaks^
   The path here heads in-between the sides of two small peaks ringed with
clouds and drops away below into an eternity of switchbacks. Somewhere in
the maze of these rarely explored peaks stands the highest volcano in the
northern regions of the continent. Mount Phaylax is never visible at any
time of year and can be reached only by this trail. Few travelers have
ever bothered to go there as it is rumored to house things which are alive
even though the volcano itself is very much extinct.

   Whiteness and clouds mislead and obscure vision, respectively, as you
leave a lonely trail of three-inch deep footprints along the trail that
has become a snow-filled ditch here. The grade continues nearly level to
the north and east, but plunges away to more sensible altitudes southward.
There is the outline of a cave within an overhang of porous rock and
thick, streaked icicles. Brief jets of warm air are vented from the

significant number of small bones strewn about, as if something once used
this room as a home. Nestled against the back is the remains of a grass
nest, matted down and decayed by the sulfur gas. Next to it lies a small
puddle of bubbling orange goo, fed by a vent directly underneath it. Fresh

of the Nolak Range, including the notably pointy Jaw of the Wolf, more 
commonly known as Mt. Cyllirus. A hulking shape to the north looms tall, dark,

which runs along the rim of the Phaylax Caldera. A walkable slope leads down

patches of volcanic mushrooms and mold. Covering nearly every square inch
of volcanic rock floor is a entanglement of thick white vines which form
the nutrient transport system for the mushroom jungle. A lizard, still
clad in full battle-gear, has had its throat completely crushed and
partially ripped by the strain of three white vines simultaneously
pulling. The barbed hooks on the vines still eagerly drink from the
dead reptilian husk. Meanwhile, a mushroom off to the side has managed to
ensnare the head of a ghoul and rip off the top half of its skull to dine
on what passes for brain material. This is one area of the city which even
most of the population won't venture into.

   The basin housing the volcano to the north stretches away to the west

much as twenty feet deep. Fortunately, most of the pack is somewhat solid  
and enchanced in strength by the surface layers of ice. Wandering aimlessly
through the caldera are many shades of the underworld, stark against the
snow and looking for bodies to drain life-force from. Cold temperatures and
the thin air here have prevented many of the corpses from decomposing, and
some faces are forever frozen in ice, shock, and pain. At least they didn't
suffer long as their spirits were sent to join the army of roamers here.

   High wind velocities rush over the upper slopes on the north side of
Mount Phaylax, sending pieces of ash and black glassy lava all over the

   Two fingers of the mountains reach far out into the sea, tapering

Inlet of the Werewolf^
   The hardiest and tastiest of the northern saltwater fish species can be
found in this inlet during the summer, when they come here in droves to
reproduce and lay their eggs. Occasionally, a shark will follow schools in
and snap a few unsuspecting fish before the rest of the school has time to
turn around and gang up on the shark. The shark is driven out and never
returns. Within the inlet, the ocean waves are relatively minor and
provide easy rocking motion in which to relax and let all of life's
worries go. This is the way of the villagers to the southeast, as they
make a killing of a living off of fishing in this cove. They also pass
their time telling repeated stories of a great aquatic terror in the open
sea, with the mouth, speed, and ferocity of a werewolf. The inlet is so
named in the honor of the tale which has kept many a petrified child
awake.

The Northern Ocean^
   Dangerous water completely surrounds you right outside the inlet. No
boat strong enough to withstand the pounding force of the open waves or
the undertow generated by each cresting swell exists yet. The only safety
lies back to the south between the sinking fingers of the Nolak Mountains,
but truly courageous adventurers may seek and never find their peril,
maiming, and doom to yonder waves. Out there, the elements have full 
control of everything, and they are in no mood to brake for anyone or
anything. Yet that environment remains ideal for larger creatures of the

   The little shanty housing all the bait seemingly ever needed to catch
every fish in the world has windows which shudder with the passing of the

rods which are used to expertly catch the inlet fish. Stacked in one
corner and tagged by name are the tackle boxes containing the personal
arsenals of bait type, line strength, and an assorted array of nasty-
looking fishhooks. Balanced woodenly against one wall is a 'jhata' -
a small, one-person craft which resembles a kayak, but is much more
streamlined and lightweight. Should anything threatening enter the inlet,
people using such a boat would be likely to leave the finned swimmer in
the dust.

Kyerstarn Village Square^
   The infamous market square of this remote village has thousands of
buisness transactions done each day. The entire open are is packed with
bazaar merchants from as far as away as the deserts near the southern end
of the continent to trade for the largest sizes in some exotic species of
fish, fresh from the north inlets. Selling at high prices while using the
resources of the inlet efficiently, the people of Kyerstarn will take gold
in exchange form their catches, but prefer cold winter survivial gear and
the wonder of knowledge. They will even sell for a good story, since they
lack many books commonplace to most of the world. What they do have is
kept safe in the library to the south, while the town meeting hall is to
the north.

Library of Kyerstarn^
   Stone bookcases with wooden supports have been constructed to hold the
books which, in time, will inhabit them. A lone clerk sits behind a desk
doing her daily work of stamping out orders for books and clearing out
receipts of sale to the library. It is also her job, and the job of
everyone, to be totally literate and help contribute to the town's poor
supply of stories. Since paper can be readily made from the Muskrat pines
to the south, the villagers use their divinely strengthened powers of
spirit and community to, quite literally, move mountains and get at the

government once a month to discuss issues of commerce and how well the the
village is doing. Previously, the issue of the weakening of the veil
guarding this world from Fallenthorp has arisen. Battles with the undead
are not taken lightly by the citizens of this concerned town, given their
proximity to Mount Phaylax. Today, the hall is deserted, and the council
members are out helping to raise capital for the village.

as the grains of the Muskrats are traded by paper agreement and confidence

   It's carp time! But then again, that is only one of the many types of
fish thrown on tables or hanging by their tails on a rack. This is where
the captured prizes of the inlet are cleaned, gutted, and made ready to be
cooked by the customer or traded away for the benefit of the entire
village. Tags marking species, weight, scarcity, and price are slapped to
each fish to allow all to see the variety of selection. On the processing
tables strewn in rows about the room are cutting blocks stained with fish
gore, with cleavers streaked with a dark, crusty red material sitting next
to the decapitated and de-tailed fish. The fishheads and fishtails make
excellent meals for the Kyerstarn husky dog population and ensure the

   To keep those who visit the village safe and warm, with good food and a

comical matters among the current owning Hunterton. Beds stacked three

small windows just above eyelevel provide a view of the village.

Park of the Divine^
   A good-sized area of lush bluegrass and fertile vegetation surrounds an

breath life from the gods into this world each time a child of any form is
born, be it animal, vegetable, or mineral. The statue is a totem depicting
the five ways of the winds and the core of ethereal power which they and
their force represent. To the people of Kyerstarn, the winds have a binding
contract to keep the village prosperous and healthy while the citizens
maintain the lockdown on The Dark City and keep its influence confined to
the volcano of Mount Phaylax.

ships must enter and leave the inlet at. The icebar also serves as the
